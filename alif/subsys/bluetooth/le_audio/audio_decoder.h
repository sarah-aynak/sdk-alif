 * SDU is available, it is decoded using the LC3 codec and pushed into the provided audio queue.
 * Either single or dual channel decoding is supported.
 *
 * @note The stack for the decoder thread is currently passed in as a parameter since at the time of
 * writing, the targeted Zephyr version does not support dynamically allocating thread stacks. It
 * would be much better to dynamically allocate the stack, as this means the correct stacksize can
 * be set internally to the module and the user does not need to know this. This PR:
 * https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/44379 adds the functionality needed, so this
 * module should be update to use dynamically allocated stacks at the point where the targeted
 * Zephyr version is updated to include this feature.
