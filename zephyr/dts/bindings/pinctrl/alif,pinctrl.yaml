    Alif Devkit pin controller is a node responsible for controlling
    function of the selected pin, pin properties, such as routing
    UART4 RX_B and UART4 TX_B on pins 12_1 and 12_2 respectively and
    settings output drive strength to any one of 2mA, 4mA, 8mA, and 12mA.

    The Devkit pin controller has the 'pinctrl' node label in SoC's
    devicetree, that can be referenced and modified as below:

    &pinctrl {
          /* all modifications go here */
    };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

    /* To avoid lengthly board.dts file due to addition of
     * pinctrl contents all contents specific to pinctrl
     * can be placed in board-pinctrl.dtsi file (e.g., ensemble-pinctrl.dtsi)
     * in your board directory and include in board.dts, or a devicetree
     * overlay in your application. */

    /* include pre-defined combinations for the SoC variant used by the board
     * */
    #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/ensemble-pinctrl.h>

    &pinctrl {
      /* configuration for the uart4 "default" state */
      pinctrl_uart4: pinctrl_uart4 {
        /* group 0 */
        group0 {
          /* configure pins P12_1 and P12_2 as UART4 RX and UART4 TX */
          pinmux = < PIN_P12_1__UART4_RX_B >,
                   < PIN_P12_2__UART4_TX_B >;
          /* enable read on pins P12_1 and P12_2 */
          read_enable = < 0x1 >;
        };
      };
      pinctrl_i3c: pinctrl_i3c {
        /* group 0 */
        group0 {
          /* configure pin P7_6 I3C_SDA */
          pinmux = < PIN_P7_6__I3C_SDA_D >;
          /* enable schimtt trigger and drive strength to 4mA on pin P7_6 */
          schmitt_enable = < 0x1 >;
          drive_strength = < 0x4 >;
        };
        /* group 1 */
        group1 {
          /* configure pin P7_7 as I3C_SCL */
          pinmux = < PIN_P7_7__I3C_SCL_D >;
          /* set drive strength to 2mA on pin P7_7 */
          drive_strength = < 0x2 >;
        };
      };
    };

    The 'pinctrl_uart4' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
    particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
    state. Similarly, for 'pinctrl_i3c' child node.

    As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each
    child node. Each group can specify a list of pin function selections
    in the 'pinmux' property.

    A group can specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
    pins in a group, such as 'read_enable' property in group 0 of
    'pinctrl_uart4' node or separate pin properties for each pin in a group
    such as 'schmitt_enable' in group 0, and 'drive_strength' in both
    group 0 and 1 of 'pinctrl_i3c' node.
    List of supported standard pin properties are below:
    - read_enable: read selection. 0 for disable and 1 for enable.
    - schmitt_enable:  schmitt trigger selection.
                       0 for disable and 1 for enable.
    - slew_rate: slew rate speed. 0 for slow and 1 for fast.
    - driver_state_control: driver disabled state control.
                            Two bits feild can be:
                            0 0 for High Z
                            0 1 for Pull up
                            1 0 for Pull down
                            1 1 for Bus repeater
    - driver_strength: output drive strength.
                            Two bits feild can be:
                            0 0 for 2mA
                            0 1 for 4mA
                            1 0 for 8mA
                            1 1 for 12mA
    - driver: driver selection. 0 for Push pull and 1 for open drain.

    To link pin configurations with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some
    number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:

       #include "board-pinctrl.dtsi"

       &uart4 {
             pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_uart4>;
             pinctrl-names = "default";
       };

       &i3c {
             pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_i3c>;
             pinctrl-names = "default";
       };
